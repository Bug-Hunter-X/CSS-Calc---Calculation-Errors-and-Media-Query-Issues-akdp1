The CSS property `calc()` can sometimes produce unexpected results if the units of measurement are inconsistent or not properly handled. For example, attempting to perform calculations involving percentages and pixels directly within a single `calc()` expression might lead to incorrect layout behavior.  Another issue can arise from using `calc()` within media queries, especially when dealing with complex expressions. The browser's interpretation of the expression may vary between different viewport sizes, potentially breaking the responsiveness of the design.
